    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    A8:73:36:E3:3E:F6:34:6F:60:C7:46:55:CD:0B:0E:92:C2:EC:2B:65

    A8:73:36:E3:3E:F6:34:6F:60:C7:46:55:CD:0B:0E:92:C2:EC:2B:65

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
